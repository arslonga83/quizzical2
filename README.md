#Quizzical2

This is my second attempt at this Scrimba solo project, after going back and working through the career path from the beginning. It came together much easier this time! It uses the Open Trivia Database API to get 5 multiple choice questions at a time, and the user can make selections, see the results, and play again. I got good practice with useState and useEffect to make this work the way I wanted. There is still sometimes a lag on the API call, so I might go back at some point and add some placeholder loading graphics.
